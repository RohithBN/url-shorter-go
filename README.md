I'll create a comprehensive README.md file for your URL shortener application.



# URL Shortener

A simple URL shortener service written in Go that allows users to create shortened URLs with either randomly generated keys or custom keys.

## Features

- Shorten long URLs with randomly generated 6-character keys
- Create custom short URLs with user-defined keys
- Web interface for URL shortening
- Redirect service for shortened URLs
- In-memory storage of URL mappings

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or higher
- `golang.org/x/exp` package for random number generation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

2. Install the required dependency:
```bash
go get golang.org/x/exp
```

## Running the Application

1. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd <project-directory>
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
go run main.go
```

3. The server will start on port 8080. You should see the message:
```
URL Shortener is running on :8080
```

## Using the Application

1. Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080/shorten
```

2. You will see a form with two input fields:
   - URL input field: Enter the long URL you want to shorten
   - Custom key field: (Optional) Enter a custom key for your shortened URL

3. Click the "Shorten" button to generate a shortened URL

## Testing the Application

1. **Basic URL Shortening**:
   - Visit `http://localhost:8080/shorten`
   - Enter a URL (e.g., `https://www.example.com`)
   - Leave the custom key field empty
   - Submit the form
   - You'll receive a shortened URL with a random 6-character key

2. **Custom Key URL Shortening**:
   - Visit `http://localhost:8080/shorten`
   - Enter a URL (e.g., `https://www.example.com`)
   - Enter a custom key (e.g., `mylink`)
   - Submit the form
   - You'll receive a shortened URL with your custom key

3. **Testing Redirects**:
   - Click on any shortened URL generated by the system
   - You should be redirected to the original URL

4. **Error Cases to Test**:
   - Try submitting an empty URL
   - Attempt to use an already existing custom key
   - Try accessing a non-existent short URL

## Limitations

- The URL mappings are stored in memory and will be lost when the server restarts
- No input validation for URLs
- No authentication or rate limiting
- Not suitable for production use without additional security measures
